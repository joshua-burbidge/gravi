# gravi

Doing some physics simulation stuff with Rust.

Uses [`wgpu`](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) (graphics) + [`femtovg`](https://github.com/femtovg/femtovg) (2D vector drawing) + [`egui`](https://github.com/femtovg/femtovg) (UI).

Created from my boilerplate here: https://github.com/joshua-burbidge/femtovg-wgpu

#### TODO
- disable/don't render ui after starting to improve performance?
  - don't clear canvas?

##### Validate
- energy drift
